Date taken should be stored as UTC and always displayed as the UTC time.

Refactor how last update time is stored to user. Currently it's stored as when the update task starts, which doesn't take into account the possibility that some or all of the photo processing tasks will fail. Should probably be set to the date_upload of the latest photo...

Eventually add a check to see if a photo already exists (maybe the date-upload was changed on Flickr).
